ClassTrim

A lightweight VSCode extension that automatically cleans up your class and className attributes. It removes extra whitespace, deletes duplicate classes, and normalizes spacing to keep your markup tidy.
Features

‚ú® Automatic Formatting: Cleans up class attributes on file save.

üö´ Duplicate Removal: Intelligently finds and removes duplicate class names.

üîß Configurable: Easily enable/disable format-on-save, customize target file types, and define which directories to process.

üéØ Smart Targeting: By default, it focuses on files within a src directory, but you can configure it for any project structure.

‚ö° Lightweight & Fast: Built to be fast and efficient with minimal performance impact.

ü§ù Broad Support: Works with both className (React) and class (HTML, Vue, Svelte).
What It Does

ClassTrim normalizes your class attributes by:

    Removing leading and trailing whitespace

    Converting multiple consecutive spaces to single spaces

    Deleting any duplicate classes from the list

    Supporting all JSX className formats and standard HTML class

Before and After

Before:

<div className="  container   header  container  button  ">
<span className={'  nav-item   active  '}>
<button class="btn   btn   primary">

After:

<div className="container header button">
<span className={'nav-item active'}>
<button class="btn primary">

Supported File Types

    TypeScript React (.tsx)

    JavaScript React (.jsx)

    HTML (.html)

    Vue (.vue)

    Svelte (.svelte)

    And any other language you configure!

How It Works

    Save Detection: Triggers when you save a file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S), if enabled.

    File Validation: Checks if the saved file matches your configured language types and path requirements.

    Pattern Matching: Finds all class and className attributes using an efficient regex pattern.

    Normalization: Cleans up whitespace and removes duplicate classes.

    Seamless Application: Applies changes as part of the save operation.
